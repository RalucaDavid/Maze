# Maze
An application made with C++ language and QT Framework that solves a maze by finding the paths to the exits with the help of the BFS(Breadth First Search) algorithm.
On the left, the graph created from the matrix placed in a file will be displayed, and on the right, the maze will be represented by the squares. The "Start BFS" button will display all exit routes from the maze from a certain starting point.

Note: The black maze background only looks good on a 6x6 matrix.
